# How to use:

# Warning!

If you already have a .vscode/settings.json this will replace it, Save a copy of your settings.json outside of .vscode/ before trying this, please


if it works but you had more things added to settings.json you'll have to add these to the new file manually

1) Make a new folder / locate your project folder
2) clone the repository on your project or download the repository as a zip
3) If you cloned it then congrats! you have installed this succesfully, if not then follow step 4
4) unzip the contents of the downloaded zip and extract on your project folder, congrats! you have installed this succesfully

If you somehow managed to mess up the procces or want to suggest any changes to these steps please open an issue
